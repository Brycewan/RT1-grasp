# RT-1-grasp

This repository contains the implementation of a grasping task based on *["RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale"](https://robotics-transformer1.github.io/)*. The project utilizes the **PyBullet** simulator for both task simulation/data generation and employs **PyTorch** for neural network training and inference
